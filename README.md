## Description
Hangman is a simple word puzzle game where you guess letters one at a time to find the target word.\
You have a maximum of 6 incorrect guesses (correct guess does not count towards "lives").

## Gameplay
A virtual keyboard is presented for you. Pressed letters will be automatically disabled, so you don't have to mind them for the rest of the game.\
Two additional buttons ***New game*** and ***Show Result*** are also available to start a new game or to show the target word, respectively.

## Files
* hangman_controller.py: the game is run within this file.
* hangman_gui.py: GUI of the game including the virtual keyboard.\
  This py file is generated by Qt Designer from the **hangman.ui** file. Feel free to generate a new one, but keep in mind once you do it, any manually coded content will be erased.
* hangman_logic.py: word processing logic of the game.
